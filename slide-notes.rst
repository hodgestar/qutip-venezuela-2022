# What are we here for?

What are we going to do in the coming hour? I am going to talk about QuTiP and show you QuTiP being used. Presumably most of you are here to learn about QuTiP, and so presumably you will do whatever is necessary for you to learn -- watch, listen, think, make notes, etc.

Two things are vital for learning -- engaging with the material at hand and feedback.

The engaging we have partly covered already, but it is worth emphasising. If you don't engage you won't learn. If you immerse yourself more deeply you will learn more. If you are not going to engage, go do something else. Don't waste your time if you're not going to engage. You are in charge of your own time and your own learning.

Now for feedback.

Inevitably during the learning process we will go astray. I will misexplain something, or explain something in a way that is not right for you as you are right now. You will misunderstand things, or fail to see that there is something to understand. None of these are things to be ashamed of -- they are just part of the process.

Effective learning requires detecting and correcting these glitches. In this lecture our primary means of feedback will be questions. Ask questions to check your understanding, and ask immediately if you do not understand something. If you don't understand something, it will make the next thing harder to follow, and you will quickly become lost.

An hour is short, so we will not get to learn very much in it -- only see a few things in one corner of QuTiP -- but if you learn often and regularly, the small pieces of learning add up, until one day someone will ask you in amazement "how did you know how to do that" and you will not be able to say exactly, except to answer "I kepted learning every day for a long time".

Onwards.
